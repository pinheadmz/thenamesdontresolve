    My name is Chad Folkening.<p>
    <p>
    I'm from the beautiful Boca Raton, Florida, here down in coastal Miami, new crypto capital of the world.<p>
    <p>
    I started in the domain space in 1996, before ICANN existed and we wanted legitimacy as an asset class. And when I put up a proposal, I was one of the very few that actually went to the White House to discuss kind of how do we can wrap this new technology out around there.<p>
    <p>
    So I appreciate everybody's time and attention 27 years later.<p>
    <p>
    Here we are.<p>
    <p>
    I'm here on the capacity of just as a member of the Handshake community, which is a decentralized, open source and transparent technology P2P naming system.<p>
    <p>
    And why I got involved with that was the amount of people involved in it and to see the new technology evolve where we're at now.<p>
    <p>
    And so one of the main goals today was to address that ICANN is hopefully that there's about a 7 million dollar, no obligation resources sitting there for them to take.<p>
    <p>
    This was created when the thing was created in February 2020, and now that value is approximately 6-7 million dollars, available for ICANN just to claim and use however they want. <p>
    <p>
    Feed the hungry kids, put it back to the community, whatever they want to do with it.<p>
    <p>
    That's one of our main goals, they're sitting there for that. <p>
    <p>
    There's now with Handshake, there's approximately 2 million domains registered on that.<p>
    <p>
    And why we support that is: the creativity.<p>
    <p>
    With the current situation, you either have to have a quarter million dollars to create a gTLD. That limits the creativity. And with this system you can actually have anybody create their own identity and creativity in that system.<p>
    <p>
    So we just really wanted to put this on record that there is a nice, sizable free, no obligation to come claim. And we want to work with the ICANN community to use these good resources.<p>
    <p>
    So, I appreciate your time. Thank you very much.

    Chad, thank you for bringing that to everyone's attention and putting an offer out there.<p>
    <p>
    Anybody from the board want to respond or from Org?<p>
    <p>
    If not...

    I want to point out that the names he represent<br>
    don't resolve in what we call the Internet.
    <p>
    Thank you very much.<p>
